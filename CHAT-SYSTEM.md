## Database Schema

### Chat Rooms (`chat_rooms`)
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- name: TEXT (room display name)
- area_name: TEXT (geographic area name)
- center_lat/lng: DECIMAL (room center coordinates)
- radius_km: INTEGER (coverage radius)
- is_active: BOOLEAN
```

### Chat Messages (`chat_messages`)
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- room_id: UUID (foreign key to chat_rooms)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key to auth.users)
- message: TEXT (message content)
- message_type: TEXT (message, system, alert_update, location_share)
- metadata: JSONB (additional data for special message types)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### Room Members (`chat_room_members`)
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- room_id: UUID (foreign key to chat_rooms)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key to auth.users)
- joined_at: TIMESTAMP
- last_seen: TIMESTAMP
- is_active: BOOLEAN
```

## Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Public room viewing** for discovering available chat areas
- **Member-only message access** - volunteers can only see messages in rooms they've joined
- **Admin oversight** - admins can view all rooms and messages
- **Volunteer-only participation** - only volunteers and admins can send messages

### Auto-Join Logic
1. Volunteer logs in and grants location permission
2. System finds nearest chat room within radius
3. Volunteer automatically joins the appropriate area room
4. Real-time updates begin immediately

## User Interface

- **Floating chat button** appears for volunteers with location access
- **Minimizable panel** (80% screen height when expanded)
- **Room information** showing area name and online volunteer count
- **Message list** with user identification and timestamps
- **Input area** with send button and location share option
- **Special message styling** for alerts and location shares

### Integration Points
